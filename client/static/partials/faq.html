			<p class='answer'>We take food safety very seriously. To that end, all of our confectioners have passed a taste test, kitchen inspection, and possess a California Food Handlerâ€™s License to get on our platform.

Our confectioners are then constantly monitored through our robust review system. Unlike traditional food establishments which may get reviewed only once a year, our confectioners are reviewed every time they share a dish.</p>
